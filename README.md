# StockPricePredictor

In this project I fed historical stock prices for Apple in the month of January 2022 to a model in an attempt to predict future stock prices. To make these predictions I used various Support Vector Regression types in hopes of getting different insight.

This project idea as well as a large part of the code is taken from Siraj Raval's youtube video "Predicting Stock Prices - Learn Python for Data Science #4" and I just made minor tweaks to make the model work with the data I was inputting.
